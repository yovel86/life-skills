# Learning Process
1. What is the Feynman technique?

* We can learn much better if we are able to explain that to someone in simple terms.

* **Diffused mode** - When we are relaxing, not thinking consciously about anything, we enter into diffused mode.

5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

* If I want to learn something, I'll try to teach that to someone after learning about it.

* Will practice a lot & do that process repeatedly to gain mastery over something.
* If I am stuck in something, will definitely take rest.
